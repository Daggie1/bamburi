During the audit actions are identified for the transporters to close within the year, with a follow up audit carried our to validate closure rate.\r\n\r\nWe have seen continuous improvement by our transporters year on year and we expect more entrants to the 5-star league in coming years. \r\n\r\nAs our transporters improve we have also as a country continued to improve our general country rating year on year.\r\n \r\nWe call on you to continue availing yourselves for road patrols, audits, as well as sharing feedback on road behavior to support our transporters ratings and to get more from the lower ranks to join the 5-star rating. \r\n\r\nCongratulations once more Team Kenya!",

      "message": "These are the three priority areas under focus for the remainder of 2018, as per Message from the CCEO dated 3rd August 2018:\r\n\r\n1.    Industrial performance\r\nThe industrial issues need to be solved quickly and everyone needs to ensure we deliver clinker production (and recover what we lost in H1), and improve clinker factor.\r\n\r\n2.    TTAT and supply chain\r\nIt is not acceptable that a customer needs to wait 7 hours to be served and a clinker truck 4 hours to be off loaded. It is important to set the basics to ensure that any truck does not wait more than 2 hours to leave the plant. This will enable us to reduce transport costs and increase our sales.\r\n\r\n3.    Cost savings\r\nIn a context where many costs have increased, we need to challenge and reduce all our costs, both industrial and SG&A. This will be implemented through a proactive negotiation from procurement and a Zero Based Budget approach for SG&A. \r\n\r\nOur focus will be on these three priorities, while ensuring that we continue to work in a safe environment. We were able to create success stories. It is still time to create other ones!\r\n\r\nFor the complete message, please refer to the Message from the CCEO circulated on 3rd August 2018 from ke-communication.department@lafargeholcim.com.",

The industrial, logistics and digital teams are working together to identify solutions to improve customer experience within our plants. In Morocco, they\u2019re implementing two exciting digital initiatives that improve the experience of customers and employees.\r\n\r\nCustomer truck information in real time\r\n\r\nThe primary goal of the digital solution \u201cMassary\u201d is to reduce the amount of time our trucks are parked and loading within the plants. But it does more. It provides real time, transparent queue management, while also controlling for the accuracy of products provided. \u201cThe tool tracks every truck from the moment they park until they exit the factory,\u201d says Lamia Joundy, Digital Operations Manager. \u201cWe use RFID badges provided to each driver when they arrive to do the tracking.\u201d\r\n\r\nThe solution is operational in Meknes plant and will be rolled out to all other sites in the country by the beginning of 2019. \u201cWe\u2019re excited by the prospects of this tool after its success in Meknes,\u201d says Idriss Elasri, Procurement, Logistics and Marketing Director.\r\n\r\nHearing directly from the customer\r\n\r\nThey didn\u2019t stop with Massary. Idriss added, \u201cWe wanted to further understand our drivers\u2019 needs in order to continue improving their experience with and perception of LafargeHolcim Morocco, so we developed an application for just this purpose.\u201d\r\n\r\nWith 3JBKOUMLHAL (\u201cAre you happy?\u201d or \u201cDid you like it?\u201d in Arabic) every driver now has the possibility to rank their experience. \u201cWe use a tablet for the drivers,\u201d explains Ghita Mouttaqi-Allah, Digital Customer Manager, \u201cwhich allows us to measure the impact of our processes on customer satisfaction \u2013 in real time.\u201d The results have led to quick wins, but also more ambitious improvements in operations. Following a test phase at the Bouskoura and Settat plants, 3JBKOUMLHAL will also be rolled out at the beginning of 2019.",

      "title": "Good Practice Sharing - Drones: changing how we operate our plants",
      "message": "In this Group case study sharing, find out how drones will help save lives, cut costs and accelerate growth.\r\n\r\nIndustry 4.0, and new process and engineering technologies are two key areas to drive the Simplification & Performance value driver of Strategy 2022 - \u201cBuilding for Growth\u201d. Both of them open up new avenues for growth and innovation, and help accelerate digitization across our industrial sites. \r\n\r\nToday, drones are readily used at our plants and are one of the innovations of Industry 4.0 where we are most advanced. This innovation is radically and rapidly changing the way we work, from protecting our employees and increasing our competitiveness, to achieving cost savings and creating efficiencies for running industrial operations. The potential for future usage of drones is huge. \r\n\r\nA recent report by Goldman Sachs* predicts that the commercial sector represents the biggest growth opportunity for drone technologies. Investments of USD 13 billion are expected in the construction industry alone by 2022. While CIP & PME have been following up on using drones in our industrial sites - from site inspections to surveys and stockpiling - the Group has only scratched the surface of what can be done with airborne drones and how this technology will change the way we work.\r\n\r\n\u201cSilo cleaning is a great example for the benefits obtained across Health & Safety, cost savings and improved productivity when using drones,\u201d explains Laurent Seyler, Head of New Technologies for CIP & PME. \u201cFirst, inspecting and cleaning cement silos is a high-exposure task where we\u2019ve unfortunately experienced fatalities in the past. In the future, we will be able to avoid sending people to inspect and clean silos or any other confined space and instead use drones,\u201d he adds.  \r\n\r\nPredictive maintenance is another key area where drones are making operations more efficient. With drones, inspections can occur at higher frequency and issues can be detected remotely through real-time imagery or non-destructive analysis before they arise. This saves time and money associated with costly repairs. \r\n\r\nFinally, where mapping, surveillance and measurement of raw materials stored in the open and requiring blast design used to be costly, the use of drones has cut this spend to a fraction of earlier levels. Says Laurent: \u201cAny way you look at it, drones are helping us to create operational excellence and greatly benefit our business.\u201d\r\n\r\nCreating competitiveness and the Plant of Tomorrow\r\n\r\n\u201cAs Drone technology continues to evolve, I believe that we will see it used in many ways as we create \u2018The Plants of Tomorrow\u2019,\u201d adds Laurent. As drones collect vast amounts of data, it will be possible to analyze and utilize the data to prepare volume calculations, create engineering designs and create 3-D in Building Information Models (BIM) using virtual reality. \u201cThis means that we will not only become more efficient in how we run our sites, reinvent processes and increase productivity, we will also create new employment opportunities at our sites for skilled people who can help turn data into actionable insights.\u201d\r\n\r\nLaurent Seyler is the Head of New Technologies for CIP and PME. His team is charged with driving disruptive change at our plants via process innovation and industry 4.0. From drones, robotics, all the way to innovative solutions that reduce C02 emissions as well as cost, this newly-formed team in Holderbank is tasked with enabling, equipping and providing best practice expertise to plant teams around the world on how to future-proof their manufacturing sites.
